# Entanglement-Dynamics-in-Dissipative-Environment-for-a-Bipartite-System

Entanglement is the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics that is a correlation between two or more quantum mechanical objects. Such correlation has no analogy in classical physics. Despite this, entanglement and its long term persistent plays a vital role in future technological revolution. This work comprises of the dynamics of initial entangled states in a dissipative environment. The dynamics of the two-qubit atomic systems and high-dimensional bipartite field states inside the two High-Q cavities encompassed by thermal environment and vacuum environment are investigated. For the entangled bipartite field states in thermal environment, the high dimensional states are considered as non-interacting systems. It is presumed that sudden death of entanglement (SDE) happens in non-interacting systems. The increase in the temperature of environment results in prior vanishing of entanglement. But in vacuum reservoir there is no thermal mean photon number present in the High Q-cavities. Thus we conclude that degradation of entanglement occurs due to vacuum fluctuations and Wootters concurrence is utilized as a quantitative proportion of entanglement for two-qubit atomic systems.
